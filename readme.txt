MelScrobble 0.3.0 Beta
The Melative Scrobbler for Windows

Requirements:
To build this program, you will need.
- Visual Studio 2010 with Visual Basic installed. MelScrobbleWin music detection features won't work properly since Visual Basic will compile with AnyCPU by default, which causes AMIP not to work properly
- Windows XP SP3 with .NET Framework 3.5 or higher, Windows Vista SP2 or 7

To take advantage of the music detection, you must install the approperate AMIP plugin for your music player at http://amip.tools-for.net/wiki/start

To compile, open the project and compile.
